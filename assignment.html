    Disney Cruises are one of the best vacations you will ever take. Having cruised with a different company, I was
    somewhat disappointed with the entertainment and options that they offered the 12-17 age group.
    The family entertainment is what sets Disney apart. I loved that they catered to the kids as well
    as parents. Each age group had their own assigned area as well a group family area. My 13 year old
    and 17 year old were each able to spend the day with their peers, doing age appropriate activies, with
    nightly family shows that we were all able to enjoy. The food was full of deliciousness and with rotational dining
    vactioners got to sample different cuisines each night. While dining guests are treated to a show each night.
    The Oppulent service and family service that Disney offers keeps guests coming back year after year.
