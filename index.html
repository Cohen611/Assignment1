          <p>
            The clock has just struck 9 p.m., and the Cabanas deck of the Disney Magic is full of life.
            Music booms over the speakers plays for the dancing crowd, while others watch the funnerl vision
            TV from deck chairs,content in the eveningâ€™s enjoyment. My boys and I are swaying to the music as
            we watch the fun. As the waves crash against the boat my eyes are gazed to the next port of call.
            The twinkling lights grew larger in the distance as we approach Cozumel, Mexico.
            Little do we the fun is about to begin. Pirates take over the ship and capture everyone aboard.
            In the fog we see a shadow, Captain Jack Sparrow and Mickey Mouse save the day.
            Full of bravado, they chase out the rogues and get the party back on track. To
            celebrate her victory at sea, the Disney Magic sends streams of fireworks into the air that boom
            and flash overhead.
